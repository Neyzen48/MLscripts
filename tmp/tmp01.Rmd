# Introduction

This document demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for time series forecasting by enhancing sales data with holiday events. The process involves:
  
- Loading and merging holiday event data.
- Splitting the time series into training and testing sets.
- Training multiple forecasting models (Prophet, Prophet Boost, and Linear Regression).
- Calibrating and forecasting on the test set.
- Re-fitting models on the full dataset.
- Averaging forecasts from different models for improved performance.

# Setup

Make sure to load the required packages. You may need to install any packages that are not already available in your R environment.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)
library(modeltime)
library(prophet)
# Other packages (such as xgboost) may be needed depending on your installation

# Set global chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Data Preparation

First, we load the holiday events data and merge it with the sales data. The `holiday_flag` is created to indicate whether a date corresponds to a holiday event.

```{r load-data}
# Load the holidays events data
holidays_events <- read_csv("Praxis/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/holidays_events.csv")

# Assuming Party_df is pre-loaded with your sales data, merge holiday events
Party_holidays_promo <- Party_df %>% 
  left_join(holidays_events, by = "date") %>% 
  mutate(holiday_flag = ifelse(is.na(type), 0, 1))
```

# Data Splitting

Next, we split the data into training and testing sets using a time series split. The testing set is set to assess one year of data while keeping a cumulative training set.

```{r time-series-split}
splits <- time_series_split(Party_holidays_promo, assess = "1 year", cumulative = TRUE)
```

# Retraining Models

We will train three different models: Prophet, Prophet Boost, and a Linear Regression (LM) model.

## Prophet Model

```{r prophet-model}
Prophet_model <- prophet_reg() %>%
  set_engine("prophet") %>%
  fit(
    sales ~ date + onpromotion + holiday_flag,
    data = training(splits)
  )
```

## Prophet Boost Model

```{r prophet-boost-model}
Prophet_boost_model <- prophet_boost() %>%
  set_engine("prophet_xgboost") %>%
  fit(
    sales ~ date + as.numeric(date) + month(date, label = TRUE) + onpromotion + holiday_flag, 
    data = training(splits)
  )
```

## Linear Regression Model

```{r linear-model}
LM_model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(
    sales ~ as.numeric(date) + month(date, label = TRUE) + onpromotion + holiday_flag,
    data = training(splits)
  )
```

# Modeltime Table and Calibration

The models are then combined into a modeltime table and calibrated on the testing data.

```{r modeltime-table}
model_tbl <- modeltime_table(
  Prophet_model,
  Prophet_boost_model,
  LM_model
)

calibration_tbl <- model_tbl %>%
  modeltime_calibrate(testing(splits))
```

You can review model performance using the accuracy table:

```{r model-accuracy}
calibration_tbl %>%
  modeltime_accuracy() %>%
  table_modeltime_accuracy(resizable = TRUE, bordered = TRUE)
```

# Forecasting

Forecast the future values with the calibrated models and visualize the results.

## Forecast on Testing Data

```{r forecast-testing}
calibration_tbl %>%
  modeltime_forecast(
    new_data = testing(splits),
    actual_data = Party_holidays_promo,
    conf_interval = 0.95
  ) %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast(.legend_show = TRUE, .legend_max_width = 25)
```

## Refit Models on All Data and Forecast

Refit the calibrated models using the entire dataset and generate forecasts on the testing data.

```{r refit-forecast}
refit_tbl <- calibration_tbl %>%
  modeltime_refit(data = Party_holidays_promo)

forecast_tbl <- refit_tbl %>%
  modeltime_forecast(
    new_data = testing(splits),
    actual_data = Party_holidays_promo,
    conf_interval = 0.95
  )

# Plot interactive forecast if supported by your output device
forecast_tbl %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = TRUE)
```

# Model Averaging

Here, we perform model averaging by grouping the forecasts (excluding the actual values) and computing the mean prediction along with confidence intervals.

```{r model-averaging}
mean_forcast_tbl <- forecast_tbl %>%
  filter(.key != "actual") %>%
  group_by(.key, .index) %>%  # Group all predictions for one date
  summarise(across(.value:.conf_hi, mean)) %>%  # Compute the mean for each forecast metric
  mutate(
    .model_id = 3,     # Denotes the number of models used
    .model_desc = "Average of Models"
  )

# Combine actual values with the averaged forecasts and plot
forecast_tbl %>%
  filter(.key == "actual") %>%
  bind_rows(mean_forcast_tbl) %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast()
```

# Accessing the Forecast Values

If you want to inspect the numeric forecast values, you can do so with:

```{r forecast-values}
forecast_tbl$.value
```

# Conclusion

This R Markdown document outlines a complete forecasting workflow that incorporates holiday events into the modeling process. We trained multiple models, calibrated their performance, generated forecasts, and finally applied model averaging to enhance the predictions.
